IcepapCMS 1.14 2008/mm/dd
+) Added support for the driver name conflicts
+) The upgrade firmware function gives time to the triton to compute the checksum
   before disconnecting
+) CFGINFO answers are readed until the final '$' is found

IcepapCMS 1.13 2008/04/02
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
+) The timeout errors doesn't freeze any more the application
+) When scanning a system or preparing the driver page, a clock cursor is shown

+) upper-lower case conflicts are ignored for highlighting
+) Accessing for first time does not create conflicts any more
+) Adding icepap: Notification of which location has already the system
+) Status bar conflict messages cleared when conflicts are solved
+) The system preiodic refresh task keeps only one call to refresh methods for system and crate

+) Changing location does not report connection errors (previous opened systems)
+) If the driver is in config mode, the application can perform absolute and
relative movements
+) It doesn't allow to add a system if it is already defined in the database
+) Version support with the Help->About menu action
+) The icepap system tree has the drivers sorted
+) When adding a system handle the connection exceptions like 'No route to host'
+) The VERSION file with all features/bug-fixing history


+) The config values are set to the icepap system using the ?CFGINFO order
+) The icepap systems tree is now sorted and it keeps the position
+) Driver parameters new to the GUI can be modifed in the "Unknown tab"
+) Some widgets did not highlight properly
+) All widgets have a tooltip from the src/templates/driverparameters.xml file
+) In case of removed drivers, the application does not hang any more
+) Proper refresh of the driver name properly
+) Driver name included in historic configurations
+) Historic configurations syncronizations has been revised
+) The too-slow behaviour when applying changes or signing has been fixed


IcepapCMS 1.12 2008/02/26
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
+) After applying the config, the system checks all the configuration to 
highlight possible changes
+) The application can connect to different drivers with different firmware 
versions. The parameters and the possible values for each are retrieved from 
the same drivers using ?CFGINFO, instead of hard-coded in the application
+) YELLOW highlight for values that differ from IcepapCMS and Driver, SALMON 
highlight for values that are equal in the application and the driver, but 
differ from the database values
+) The application can work with: IDLE VOLTAGE, REGULATION GAIN, POSITION SRC, 
IDLE CURRENT, BOOST CURRENT, and ALL SSI parameters
+) Change ENABLE/DISABLE with ON/OFF
+) The application supports connections and disconnections from the icepap 
systems without hanging

IcepapCMS 1.11 2008/02/21
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
+) Sign driver configuration should save data in the database
+) Regulation gain should be inside the 'Pi Current Regulation' section
+) Drop down menus should be also yellow when changing the values
+) The preferences dialog should end with an OK button instead of a CLOSE 
button
+) Log window for firmware upgrade should auto scroll-down
+) Icepap systems tree puts at bottom the last opened system it should 
preserve the systems' order presented at startup
+) Idle voltage should be presented AFTER nominal voltage
+) The parameter for signing could be epoch in hex + hostname
+) Microstepping should disappear from the test tab
+) When closing the application, it should close the console
+) Typo: The tune testing tab should say 'INFO SIGNALS' instead of 'INFO 
SINGAL'
+) Typo: Right click a driver, the popup should say 'SYSTEM' instead 
of SYSTEN'
+) When displaying a driver, the version shown should be the driver's one 
instead of the DSP one
+) BM01 gets stuck when reading 4 crates
+) The Add/Remove Icepap System action should commit to the database, by now, 
it only commits on exit
+) The communication test in the Upgrade firmware window doesn't work
+) The Default acceleration time should inform that it is in SECOND units
