+) New conflict resolution based on EXPERT_FLAG
   - New drivers: Prompt "Reset to default?" Cancel | Ok (both answers resolve conflict)
   - Moved drivers: Same as New Drivers (Do not prompt for all configs of the same driver
   - Modified without EXPERT flag: "Set DataBase Values?" Cancel | Ok (only Ok resolves conflict)
   - Modified with EXPERT flag: "Set Driver Values?" Cancel | Ok (only Ok resolves conflict)
   - If expert flag is detected, the application removes the flag from the driver
   - The YES-NO dialog shows the parameters which differ
+) Firmware versions check (master != drivers) and upgrade progress bar

+) Some widgets did not highlight properly
+) All widgets have a tooltip from the

IcepapCMS 1.12 2008/02/26
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
+) After applying the config, the system checks all the configuration
   to highlight possible changes
+) The application can connect to different drivers with different
   firmware versions. The parameters and the possible values for each
   are retrieved from the same drivers using ?CFGINFO, instead of
   hard-coded in the application
+) YELLOW highlight for values that differ from IcepapCMS and Driver,
   SALMON highlight for values that are equal in the application and
   the driver, but differ from the database values
+) The application can work with: IDLE VOLTAGE, REGULATION GAIN,
   POSITION SRC, IDLE CURRENT, BOOST CURRENT, and ALL SSI parameters
+) Change ENABLE/DISABLE with ON/OFF
+) The application supports connections and disconnections from the
   icepap systems without hanging

IcepapCMS 1.11 2008/02/21

+) The parameter for signing could be epoch in hex + hostname
+) Microstepping should disappear from the test tab
+) When closing the application, it should close the console
